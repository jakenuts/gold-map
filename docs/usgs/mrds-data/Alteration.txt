Also evident is remobilization of carbon and  oxidation and redistribution. Minor bleaching, calcite veining, argillization. All alteration types occur mainly up dip from the feeder structure. The oxidation of pyrite and subsequent remobilization of iron oxides have produced spectacular brick-red to dark yellow brown banding in the oxidized, decalcified limestone. In many areas the ore exhibits intense liesegang banding. Most of the calcite veining is characterized by 0.1-30 cm veins located up dip from the orebody. Argillization is rare. Illitic clays have been locally altered to montmorillonite and allophane.  "	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"

Quartz replacement in Pilot Shale closely follows the contact between ore and waste, whereas in Devils Gate Limestone, a stratiform jasperoid replacement body extends well beyond the ore zones. Beyond the area of silicification, diagenetic dolomite in Pilot Shale was replaced by hydrothermal calcite, and calcite veins comprised as much as 10% of the host rocks. Following gold deposition, intense oxidation destroyed organic matter, sulfides, and detrital illite in Pilot Shale and alunite and/or barite veins were deposited; this event is thought to be hydrothermal. Lastly, oxidation related to weathering deposited jarosite and goethite. Shifts in the isotopic compositions of carbonate are associated with gold mineralization."

In the North area deposits, the sedimentary rocks are variably hornfelsed and were locally pervasively argillized. Siliciclastic rocks are decalcified within ore zones with minor silicification adjacent to ore zones. Pervasive secondary iron oxides resulted from the oxidation of marcasite and pyrite in the host rocks. Higher grade ore is indicated by chocolate-brown goethite."

Maas and others (1995) interpret this zone as hydrothermally altered mafic metavolcanic rock.   Early miners called this altered rock 'blue porphyry,' which they interpreted as crosscutting altered dikes that predate the quartz veins, but are closely associated with some of the orebodies (Brooks, 1902, p. 65; Wright and Wright, 1908, p. 143).  Gold content of these pyritic altered zones is high adjacent to the quartz veins and diminishes away from them.  Weathered altered rocks have a reddish-brown, oxidized rind up to three inches thick."

Minor skarn development includes pyroxene-fluorite +/- quartz, calcite, scheelite, scapolite, and pyrrohotite selvages in marble adjacent to small granite pegmatites.  Calcite-muscovite-fluorite-tremolite rocks found on mine dumps may be a replacement selvage in marble but they are not abundant in the area.  Discontinuous and small quartz veins also contain muscovite, some tourmaline, and locally abundant iron-oxide.  However, many altered fractures or veins consisting of gossanous quartz+/-tourmaline contain only anomalous amounts of tin.

The sample line along lower Bonanza Creek by Freeman and others (1988) indicates that sulfide minerals make up 10% of the rock.  Sulfide mineralogy is dominated by subequal amount of pyrtie and arsenopyrite with rare chalcopyrite and sphalerite.  Sulfide minerals occur as extremely fine-grained disseminations within the foliation of the schists.  Late stage quartz veins commonly contain small amounts of pyrite or arsenopyrite.  Iron oxides have formed after pyrite and pale green scorodite has formed after arsenopyrite.  Local pale yellow stibiconite indicates the presence of antimony-bearing minerals (Freeman and others, 1988)."	"MRDS migration"	"29-OCT-2002 09:07:14"	"ARDF Migration"	"23-AUG-2007 04:16:35"

Magnetite in the calcite-quartz-chlorite zone goes to pyrite in the illite-montmorillonite zone.

In the oxide zone, white kaolinite-rich rocks are found at the center surrounded by purple montmorillonite-rich rocks in peripheral locations.  The change in color typically marks the edge of the possible ore zone.  Major elements introduced during alteration include Si, Al, K, and Ti.

Sulfides are restricted to later fractures.    Endoskarn: sulfide-poor calc-silicate mineral assemblages which occur as alteration products of porphyry dikes are common west and southwest of the open pit, rare in the open pit, and absent east and north of the pit. In some hand specimens, endoskarn alteration can be observed as envelopes about individual quartz veins, e.g. plagioclase-quartz-pyroxene-bearing inner envelopes (hornblende destroyed) and relict hornblende-stable outer envelopes.    Potassic alteration: shreddy hydothermal biotite is abundant in dikes in the open pit and the degree of biotization is independent of proximity to quartz veins.    Prograde skarn: a few unequivocal but rare examples of coarse grained garnet-pyroxene skarn have been exposed in the center of the open pit, interbedded with calc-silicate hornfels. These skarns contain pyrite, although it is unclear whether it was deposited synchronous with skarn silicates.    Retrograde skarn: pyroxene hornfels and less commonly basalt and biotite hornfels locally are intensely altered to dark green chlorite, pyrite, and nontronite(?). This assemblage has been reported to carry free gold.  "	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"

In the main ore zone, Bakken (1990) has identified 5 mappable alteration types based on progressive carbonate dissolution (types 1, 2, and 3) and silica replacement (types 4 and 5).  High grade gold is associated with type three alteration (complete carbonate removal and doubling of porosity).  Jasperoids occur both along bedding planes and as fault fillings discordant to bedding.  The discordant jasperoids average around 1 m thick and most often occupy structures striking N40-70E and dipping steeply south.  Alteration and mineralization patterns tend to center around these jasperoid bodies. "	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"

Fluid-inclusion studies by Pearcy and Petersen (1990) indicated a steady decrease in temperature through the paragenetic sequence from 190 to 100?C.  They concluded that the hot-springs currently depositing gold and mercury reflect the waning stages of the hydrothermal system. They resolved twelve stages of vein mineralization and three major wall-rock alteration events as follows (minerals listed are for wall-rock alteration):\n\nStage I:  adularization; adularia, sericite, chalcedony, pyrrhotite\nStages II-XI:  silicic-carbonate; dolomite \nStage XII: argillic; smectite-illite, pyrite, marcasite, cinnabar; at least 150-180 meters deep                                                \n                        advanced argillic; allophane, gypsum, native sulfur, jarosite\n\nWall-rock alteration in stages I and XII was strong, while alteration in stages II-XI was weak. Gold mineralization occurred during stages V, VI, and IX; cinnabar in Stages VII, XI, and XII; and iron sulfides are found in veinlets in every stage with one exception.  In stage XII, pyrite occurs in the wallrock but not in the veinlets.\n \nAlteration began at about 0.56 ? 0.14 Ma (K-Ar, adularia), corresponding to Clear Lake volcanism.  The mudstone, hardened by adularization and silicification, became dark, chert-like, and brittle. Subsequent deformation resulted in a meshwork of fractures in which gold mineralization occurred.\n\n\n"	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"

Sulfide and oxide alteration typically form envelopes paralleling the shear.  Alteration in the footwall reaches at least 40 feet from the shear near the Vetter shaft while alteration in the hanging wall is minor.  Scorodite and hematite alteration were most prevalent in the western portion of the deposit.  Antimony oxide alteration becomes pervasive in the central portion where quartz-free pods of massive, striated stibnite occur (Fairbanks Exploration Inc., unpublished report, 1988)."

The lode contains fractures filled with gossanized quartz veins with voids and localized sericite.  McCoy and others (1997) describe several stages of alteration at the Democrat Lode.  An early stage of alteration consists of quartz-tourmaline-muscovite +/- biotite +/- K-spar +/- clinozoisite.  The stage more commonly associated with gold is an assemblage of quartz-white mica +/- ankerite +/- carbonaceous material.  Albite is present in veins with quartz (R.J. Newberry, oral communication, 1998).  The surrounding gneiss displays evidence of hornfelsing (K. Ausburn, oral communication, 1998)."

During Jurassic regional metamorphism, the three primary host lithologies underwent the following changes: 1) in the more siliceous units, quartz was locally recrystallized and feldspar fragments and interstitial clays were mostly converted to sericite, 2) the clay portion of shaley siltstones was altered to sericite while the quartz portion was largely unaffected, and 3) mudstones were converted to argillites consisting mostly of fine grained sericite. Tertiary hydrothermal alteration overprints pervasive metamorphically derived quartz-sericite and is most intense within and adjacent to shear zones and hydrothermal conduits and beneath impermeable rock units. The major hypogene minerals are quartz, kaolinite, and alunite. Quartz occurs as fracture filling, selective replacements of calcareous units, and as irregular flat-lying cryptocrystalline bodies. Hydrothermally altered argillaceous rocks are pervasively kaolinized, although more siliceous units have undergone only minor argillization. Supergene alunite and kaolinite have formed by the downward percolation of acid solutions along faults and fracture zones. These fracture zones often contain calcite, exotic hematite, goethite, and sparse native sulfur. Extensive surficial bleaching is also attributed to acid leaching in the secondary environment. Hematite derived from syngenetic sulfides was mobilized by acid solutions, resulting in a pervasive maroon stain in silty units marginal to bleached areas.\n"	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"

Carbonization (up to 3% by weight organic carbon) is the dominant alteration type in the deposit and can give a sooty appearance to the rocks.  Silicification is strongest at the northern end of the deposit and decreases to the south.  Argillization is primarily confined to fractures in lower plate carbonates associated with carbonization.  The clays are generally illitic.  Supergene oxidation is evident throughout the deposit area as limonitic and hematitic staining along fractures.  Skarn development is associated with the emplacement of a Cretaceous granitic stock.  Two prograde, skarn zones are developed, both barren of gold.  A retrograde skarn alteration mineral assemblage consists of chlorite, tremolite, epidote, calcite, quartz, illite, nontronite, smithsonite(?), pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, arsenopyrite, and galena.

The oxidation of pyrite and subsequent remobilization of iron oxides have produced spectacular brick-red to dark yellow brown banding in the oxidized, decalcified limestone. In many areas the ore exhibits intense liesegang banding. Most of the calcite veining is characterized by 0.1-30 cm veins located up dip from the orebody. Argillization is rare.

Maas and others (1995) interpret this zone as hydrothermally altered mafic metavolcanic rock.   Early miners called this altered rock 'blue porphyry,' which they interpreted as crosscutting altered dikes that predate the quartz veins, but are closely associated with some of the orebodies (Brooks, 1902, p. 65; Wright and Wright, 1908, p. 143).  Gold content of these pyritic altered zones is high adjacent to the quartz veins and diminishes away from them.  Weathered altered rocks have a reddish-brown, oxidized rind up to three inches thick."

Groundmass is altered to chlorite +/- clay +/- carbonate+/- epidote.  Plagioclase phenocrysts are altered to sericite (illite) as small points, clots, and veinlets along cleavage planes.  Argillically altered rock contains no unaltered biotite or plagioclase, both phases being altered to clay (illite, montmorillonite, kaolinite) and sericite.  Groundmass is entirely composed of fine-grained clays and sericite.  Quartz-adularia silicification is widespread along the veins.

Fine-grained secondary quartz has replaced original plagioclase feldspars, occurs as clots in the groundmass, and as hairline veinlets that lace the rock."

Introduction of metasomatic fluids further extended the biotite halo, flooding the system with k and fe, and adding orthoclase to the biotite hornfels assemblage.  This assemblage replaced much of the protolith regardless of original composition.  Continued metasomatism at high temperature (300C - 550C) formed garnet and pyroxene in calcareous rocks and overprinted the biotite-orthoclase hornfels. Sulfide minerals, dominated by pyrrhotite, began to precipitate with the garnet-pyroxene skarn and continued as temperatures declined.  Gold mineralization began at 300C-400C and continued to lower temperatures along with minor arsenopyrite, pyrite, marcasite, sphalerite, galena, bismuth, and tellurides.  During cooling of the hydrothermal system, the garnet-pyroxene skarn was altered to actinolite, prehnite, and chlorite.

Maas and others (1995) interpret this zone as hydrothermally altered mafic metavolcanic rock.   Early miners called this altered rock 'blue porphyry,' which they interpreted as crosscutting altered dikes that predate the quartz veins, but are closely associated with some of the orebodies (Brooks, 1902, p. 65; Wright and Wright, 1908, p. 143).

Maas and others (1995) interpret this zone as hydrothermally altered mafic metavolcanic rock.   Early miners called this altered rock 'blue porphyry,' which they interpreted as crosscutting altered dikes that predate the quartz veins, but are closely associated with some of the orebodies (Brooks, 1902, p. 65; Wright and Wright, 1908, p. 143).  Gold content of these pyritic altered zones is high adjacent to the quartz veins and diminishes away from them.  Weathered altered rocks have a reddish-brown, oxidized rind up to three inches thick."

Locally limy beds are recrystallized and calc-silicate minerals are developed. Hydrothermal alteration consists chiefly of decarbonatization accompanied by silicification in the limestone beds.

Zones of intense iron oxidation (goethite and limonite) follow fractures and veins to depths as much as 365 meters below the surface.  In the Main gold zone, a gray pervasive silicification resembling jasperoid is associated with gold mineralization, although open-space drusy quartz is also common.\nA thick layer of opaline sinter overlies the gold mineralized units and capping mudstone.

Maas and others (1995) interpret this zone as hydrothermally altered mafic metavolcanic rock.   Early miners called this altered rock 'blue porphyry,' which they interpreted as crosscutting altered dikes that predate the quartz veins, but are closely associated with some of the orebodies (Brooks, 1902, p. 65; Wright and Wright, 1908, p. 143).

Altered volcanic rocks show characteristically anomalous geochemical signatures in mercury, arsenic, and antimony. Alteration is that typically associated with volcanic-hosted epithermal systems and consists of blanket argillic bleaching with disseminated limonite (pyrite at depth) along a broad arc across the district.  All gold mineralization in the district appears to be associated with this regional alteration pattern, which in turn is controlled by both caldera structures and rock permeability. The lapilli tuffs appear to be the most permeable rocks in the area.Alteration and mineralization post-date the rhyolite."	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"01-SEP-07"	"PSCHRUBE"	"16-SEP-08"

Potassium silicate alteration occurs adjacent to the porphyry intrusions and consists mainly of alkali feldspar, biotite, tourmaline, allanite, and quartz.  A chlorite-sericite-carbonate alteration assemblage occurs sporadically in the area.  The most widespread type of alteration at Liberty Bell is a quartz-sericite-clay assemblage.

Tin is commonly anomalous in these rocks and in places exceeds 0.1%.  Sericite and tourmaline development is ubiquitous in granite intrusions of the prospect area.

Partial removal of carbonate from originally calcareous rocks preceded gold mineralization and resulted in increased porosity and permeability.  In some ore zones, intensely argillized rocks above and below mineralization may have served as impermeable seals to confine later gold-bearing hydrothermal fluids.  Silicification may be coeval with gold deposition and is represented by local replacement of favorable lithologies and jasperoid development in fault zones.

10936	"10310352"	1	"L"	""	"Alteration comments: propylitization, alunite-jarosite alteration, argillization, dense silicification, powdery silicification (acid leaching?). Oligocene andesite and Oligo-Miocene tuff underlying the principal ore host rocks are weakly to strongly propylitized, which probably reflects deuteric alteration that predates the main hydrothermal system at paradise peak. Hypogene alunite-jarosite alteration primarily occurs as a crudely stratiform layer 20-40 m thick below hydrothermal breccias that cap the deposit and above the main silicified ore zone. Argillic alteration consists dominantly of smectite, opal-ct, quartz and leucoxene, with minor mixed layer illite-smectite and/or kaolinite present. Unoxidized argillized rocks also contain 5-15% disseminated fine grained pyrite and/or marcasite. Argillization is well developed in the upper andesites that overlie the main silicified zone and in the dacite porphyry below the main silicified zone. Both alunite-jarosite alteration and argillization possibly occurred during the  early stages of dense silicification. Two types of silicification, dense and powdery, are distinguished on cross sections and bench maps and are the two  dominant textural types of silicification present in the deposit, although all gradations exist. Dense silicification consists of very fine-grained quartz (0.01-0.05 mm) and/or opal, 5-20% fine grained diseminated marcasite and/or pyrite (typically <0.025 mm), and a TiO2 phase (anatase or leucoxene) that totally replace the rock except for quartz and zircon phenocrysts. Dense silicification is associated with au-ag deposition. Relict textures in powdery silicified rocks suggest that many of these rocks were first densely silicified (+ fine-grained sulfide minerals) and were later oxidized, partially leached, and recrystallized to powdery silica (acid leaching by ascending fluids?). Powdery silica alteration is associated with mercury deposition.  "	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"

The shear zones are fragmental and/or brecciated, containing  very fine-grained quartz, sericite, and pyrite or limonite. Pyrite occurs secondary in fractures. Away from the shear zones the rhyolite gradually becomes fresher, grading outward from a rock with relict feldspar ghosts to one with a distinct porphyritic texture. In the center of the intrusion the rocks have a granular texture in which the feldspars have been altered, leaving open, clay-filled vugs. ?Sanded rhyolite? and ?rhyolite sand? are terms used by Newmont to describe a unique texture of the rhyolite often occurring in mineralized areas. The sanded rhyolite consists of medium-grained rounded clasts of glassy rhyolite breccia occurring near the margins and at the base of the intrusive. Sediments along the margins of the rhyolite intrusive and immediately beneath it have been silicified, decalcified and sulfidized. In and around the mineralized cells, the sediments have been extensively oxidized (hypogene)."	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"

11270	"10310397"	1	"L"	""	"Rocks in the mine area have been affected by silicic, potassic, argillic, and advanced argillic alterations. Silicic alteration is characterized by an increase in quartz or other silica minerals in the host rock; the total silica content of the rock may or may not have increased. Quartz veins commonly accompany silicic alteration, but their presence is not diagnostic of silicic alteration. Rock hardness and resistance to erosion are the primary field criteria for recognizing silicic alteration. Silicic alteration preferentially affects the fine-grained matrix within fragmental host rocks such as the lithic tuff unit and the interstratified siltstone and volcanic breccia unit. More intense silicic alteration is characterized by the replacement of the fine-grained matrix of these rocks by a mosaic of coarser-grained quartz that commonly contains abundant minute rhombs of adularia. Intense silicic alteration results in rock containing only quartz, adularia, and pyrite (or limonite) in significant amounts. Silicic alteration is closely associated with gold ore in the Crazy Hill ore zone. All mineralized rock at rawhide has been potassically altered to some degree, as evidenced by the presence of adularia. The degree of potassic alteration can be adequately assessed only be microscopic identification of adularia and therefore is more difficult to recognize in the field. Three principal habits of adularia are recognized: 1) partial to complete replacement of primary feldspar phenocrysts, 2) overgrowth rims of adularia, and 3) small (typically 0.01-0.1 mm) euhedral rhombs associated with strong silicic alteration. Argillic alteration is characterized by the development of significant quantities of clay minerals (calcite) at the expense of groundmass, mafic minerals, and all phenocrysts except those of adularia and quartz, and apparently has resulted from numerous events including late supergene alteration related to the oxidation of sulfides. The dominant clay minerals formed include illite, kaolinite, and chlorite. Lesser amounts of mixed layer illite-smectites and montmorillonite are present. Argillic alteration is the dominant alteration type at Rawhide and forms a broad halo around more silicified and potassically altered rock, extending well beyond the limits of precious metal mineralization. Argillically altered rock is devoid of precious metal mineralization. The advanced argillic alteration mineral assemblage consists of kaolinite+alunite+quartz, chalcedony or opal. Advanced argillic alteration commonly occurs as irregular bleached zones up to a few inches thick along the margins of paragenetically late veins of kaolinite+alunite+chalcedony. It has only been recognized in oxidized portions of the deposit and may be related to lat"	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"

The early veins are typified by white quartz containing arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite and loellingite with secondary biotite in selvages up to 1 meter in width.  The later veins are typified by gray quartz as stockwork veins and replacement selvages containing arsenopyrite and pyrite, along with secondary disseminated sericite and dolomite.  It is common to find the sericite-dolomite alteration overprinted upon the earlier secondary biotite.  Some silica flooding is observed in the gneiss and intrusive (M.

In the jasperoid breccia with clay seams, gold mineralization is related to both silicification and argillization. In the mixed breccia and limestone breccia, gold mineralization is associated with argillic alteration. A detailed comparison of alteration with gold grade from drill data indicates that the highest gold values are often associated with argillic alteration rather than silicification. At surface, diorite intrusives are both  extensively oxidized and propylitized."	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"

Groundmass is altered to chlorite +/- clay +/- carbonate+/- epidote.  Plagioclase phenocrysts are altered to sericite (illite) as small points, clots, and veinlets along cleavage planes.  Argillically altered rock contains no unaltered biotite or plagioclase, both phases being altered to clay (illite, montmorillonite, kaolinite) and sericite.  Groundmass is entirely composed of fine-grained clays and sericite.  Quartz-adularia silicification is widespread along the veins. Degree of silicification, sericite + argillic alteration increases with (higher) elevation. Fine-grained secondary quartz has replaced original plagioclase feldspars, occurs as clots in the groundmass, and as hairline veinlets that lace the rock."

12314	"10310440"	1	"L"	""	"Alteration at South Bullion consists of silicification, decalcification, and argillization. Alteration within the Trout Creek portion of the deposit consists predominantly of  silicification and  hematization.\nGold mineralization is intimately related, both temporally and spatially, to silicification of the Webb Formation. Silicification of the Webb Formation has resulted in 1) replacement of primary calcareous material by authigenic quartz, forming the major portion of the fine grained jasperoid, 2) development of quartz overgrowths, some of which are multiple overgrowths, 3) the in-filling of fractures and vugs by coarse anhedral and euhedral quartz, and 4) pervasive silica flooding along zones of induced secondary porosity and permeability. Portions of the Webb Formation and Devils Gate Limestone are decalcified in an envelope to the jasperoid. An unsilicified portion of the Webb Formation that directly overlies the jasperoid contains numerous fine calcite veinlets; a similar zone occurs directly below the jasperoid and is characterized by massive vein- and cavity-filling sparry calcite. Weak argillic alteration is suggested by the presence of dispersed hydrothermal clays within the Webb Formation and the Chainman Shale at both the local and district scales. Due to the regional extent of the clays, as contrasted to the limited area of gold mineralization, the gold is thought to not necessarily be temporally associated with this weak argillization event."

The deposit also has undergone supergene enrichment,  and calcareous schists near the complex have undergone calc-silicate hornfelsing and iron metasomatism..   The early potassic and propylitic alteration centers around a 330-foot-  diameter zone of stockwork quartz veins.  Potassic alteration extends west for about 3600 feet, and gradually transitions to propylitic alteration.  Quartz veins in the stockwork zone make up to 90% of the rock.  Older, smaller 'A'- type veins containing potassium-feldspar margins locally contain molybdenum, pyrite, and chalcopyrite.  Younger, larger, 'B'- type veins usually contain molybdenum in their cores or along selvages.  Sericite, anhydrite, and andalusite occur along some vein margins..   The propylitic alteration consists of chlorite, epidote, calcite, actinolite,  montmorillonite, and chalcedonic quartz.  The later sericite-quartz-pyrite alteration is fracture controlled and pervasive through the intrusive complex..   A zone of supergene enrichment underlies the oxide (gossan) zone, which  typically is 300-400 feet deep. The supergene zone contains chalcocite and sparse covellite and native Cu, as well as pyrite and chalcopyrite. Within the oxide zone, goethite, hematite, jarosite, and limonite are common.  The oxidation of these rocks results in the formation of a kaolinite-sericite-quartz assemblage that is leached of all sulfides."

12847	"10310319"	1	"L"	""	"Alteration of rhyolitic host rock consists predominantly of silicification, argillic alteration, acid leaching, and supergene alteration. Replacement and open-space filling by silica minerals are the most prominent and diagnostic alteration styles at Sleeper. Early silicification, accompanied by pyrite, resulted in pervasive replacement of plagioclase phenocrysts and groundmass by opaline silica. Alunite occurs in some early silicified rocks, but possibly was a later addition. Silicification of several types accompanied ore stages. Late-stage silicification in the form of opal is controlled by post-ore faults and fractures and is barren of gold. This late opal typically contains abundant light-colored alunite, kaolinite, or jarosite. Small amounts of native sulfur are enclosed in the late silica. Hypogene argillic alteration occurs peripheral to zones of early silicification; commonly there is a transition zone from 3 to 50 m wide of clay-altered plagioclase in silicified groundmass. The broad argillized zones are barren of Ag and Au, and contain little sulfide and no silica veinlets. Feldspar phenocrysts and aphanitic groundmass in argillized zones commonly are altered to clay minerals, most commonly kaolinite, smectite, and illite. Plagiocalse phenocrysts have been replaced by fine-grained clay minerals and alunite. Sanidine is locally altered to sericite or kaolinite. Groundmass is generally altered to very fine grained silica-clay mixtures. Thoroughly acid-leached rocks with sponge-like texture of more than 90% silica occur in local zones along post-ore faults.  Subsequently, opal, alunite, and jarosite were deposited in the porous rocks. \nThe prominent red coloration of upper pit walls reflects supergene destruction of sulfides and local redistribution of iron into fractures. Pyritic tuffs have been oxidized to tan alunite+jarosite+limonite-bearing mixtures. Feldspars are altered to white clays along open fractures and voids later filled by phases of unusual composition, some rich in Cl (as NaCl and AgCl), and various combinations of Al, Mn, and Co As oxides or sulfates. \n\nPropylitically altered tuffaceous sediments, andesitic lava flows, and metasedimentary basement rocks underlie the rhyolitic host rock."

The pervasive propylitic assemblage consists of chlorite, zeolites, calcite, smectite clays, sodic rims on plagioclase (partial albitization), minor quartz and epidote, and trace to 2% disseminated pyrite. Magnetite is generally stable. The intensity of propylitic alteration increases with proximity to mineralized veins. Phyllic alteration is dominated by sericite and pyrite (3-5%) with lesser amounts of quartz and adularia. Celadonite and illite are also present. Phyllic alteration is generally pervasive throughout the andesite unit and the andesite breccia subunit. The silicic assemblage consists of multiple stages of banded chalcedony and drusy quartz  adularia and contains minor sulfides, sulfosalts, and electrum. Quartz-adularia intergrowths commonly replace calcite cleavage planes. Silicic alteration is manifest by a well developed vein stockwork crosscutting the andesite unit, as a pervasive replacement, and as matrix to irregular zones of hydrothermal breccias. The silicic assemblage overprints both phyllic and propylitic alteration and represents the main stage of precious metal deposition. The argillic assemblage consists of montmorillonite clays, kaolinite, alunite, allophane, halloysite, jarosite, gypsum, and iron oxides. Argillic alteration is best developed in fault zones. It also occurs as a pervasive supergene product of pyrite oxidation, overprinting both phyllic and propylitic assemblages. The opaline assemblage consists of massive, multi-colored opaline-chalcedonic breccia containing iron oxides and occasional cinnabar. Opaline breccia appears to be replacing andesite tuff-breccia. The opaline breccia may represent a higher level equivalent to the silicic assemblage, deposited near the paleosurface.

Maas and others (1995) interpret this zone as hydrothermally altered mafic metavolcanic rock.   Early miners called this altered rock 'blue porphyry,' which they interpreted as crosscutting altered dikes that predate the quartz veins, but are closely associated with some of the orebodies (Brooks, 1902, p. 65; Wright and Wright, 1908, p. 143).  Gold content of these pyritic altered zones is high adjacent to the quartz veins and diminishes away from them.  Weathered altered rocks have a reddish-brown, oxidized rind up to three inches thick."

Cordierite, andalusite, and biotite of the metamorphic aureole are altered to sericite and/or chlorite. Igneous dikes and portions of the main stock are altered such that plagioclase is altered to sericite and kaolinite and biotite is altered to sericite, chlorite, and pyrite.

Silicification is widespread throughout the district and is evidenced by abundant jasperoid.  Gold ore is often found in decalcified limestone.  Argillization is widespread, but argillized rocks are generally not mineralized.  The amount of carbonaceous ore has now been shown to be at least in part due to finely disseminated sulfide, not carbon."

Locally limy beds are recrystallized and calc-silicate minerals are developed. Hydrothermal alteration consists chiefly of decarbonatization accompanied by silicification in the limestone beds. Cordierite, andalusite, and biotite of the metamorphic aureole are altered to sericite and/or chlorite. Igneous dikes and portions of the main stock are altered such that plagioclase is altered to sericite and kaolinite and biotite is altered to sericite, chlorite, and pyrite.

Iron-oxide and jarosite staining is the most visually striking characteristic of the Wind Mountain deposit.  Strongly argillized rocks occur in an area exceeding 6.5 square km.  The clay minerals of 15 samples of intensely argillized rock average 60% montmorillonite, 30% illite, 10% kaolinite, strongly silicified rocks (>70% silica) comprise a zone 100 meters wide and 1700 meters long at the central core and west side of Wind Mountain.  About 10% of this silica is light blue colored opaline rock.  At least 80% of the silicified rocks consist of dense, hard, crystalline alpha-quartz.  Silicified rocks are best developed along high-angle faults (e.g. Wind Mountain fault).  Stratiform silicified zones extend over 300 meters from the Wind Mountain fault and generally thin away from the structure.  Native sulfur is common in acid leached zones.  Three such acid leached zones are recognized, one of which overlies the west side of the Wind Mountain orebody."

Maas and others (1995) interpret this zone as hydrothermally altered mafic metavolcanic rock.   Early miners called this altered rock 'blue porphyry,' which they interpreted as crosscutting altered dikes that predate the quartz veins, but are closely associated with some of the orebodies (Brooks, 1902, p. 65; Wright and Wright, 1908, p. 143).
