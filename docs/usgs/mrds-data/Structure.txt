Compressional deformation of the Sonoma Orogeny occurred in the late Permian, during which the foredeep accumulated Schoonover Sequence was thrust over both the allochthonous western and autochthonous eastern assemblage rocks. Sonoma tectonism in the Big Springs area is evidenced by SE-verging overturned folds and imbricate thrust faults, all of which have been cut by later normal faults.

They generally are subtle features that trend N 30? to 40? W and that become evident only after regional mapping and compilation and are not as obvious as the north-striking fault zones. Three such northwest-striking zones have been delineated in the Battle Mountain mining district. The Northwest-striking structural zones in the Battle Mountain mining district are apparently pre-Late Cretaceous in age based on the orientation and age of the monzogranite of Trenton Canyon. The northwest zones may coincide with shattered hingelines of large-scale folds associated with a regional Jurassic compressional event (Doebrich and Theodore, 1996)."

A low-angle fault forms the footwall of the gold mineralization in the favorble host rocks at the West Zone.

Two stages of thrusting are represented. Both strike-slip and dip-slip movements are recognized on the high angle structures, but dip-slip movement dominates.

It spans an age of at least 10 million years (23-13 Ma), an unusually long activity period for a caldera complex. It is bounded on its northern and southern sides by transverse zones, which are east-striking late Mesozoic to Cenozoic structures that cross the Great Basin and accommodate different amounts, types, and rates of crustal extension to the north and south. The Caliente complex was highly extended along transverse zones and faults that were synchronous with caldera magmatism.

There is a 'Main Vein' which is a dominant structure with a distinct footwall, complexed by several conjugate veins to the west. Sub-parallel, mineralised structures have also been found up to 200 m into the footwall of this main structure, while alteration, fault gouge and mineralisation occur up to 500 m to the east into its hangingwall (FirstMiss Gold Inc., 1993). Movement on the Getchell Fault has been both normal and dextral strike-slip (McCollum & McCollum 1990). On the basis of the relative displacement of the Palaeozoic sediments and the Cretaceous granodiorite of the Osgood Mountain Stock it is believed that the Getchell Fault is a reactivated older structure (D Bond, Pers. comm., 1993). The most recent displacement has taken place during the Miocene to present Basin and Range movement, representing further reactivation of an older structure. The fault cuts all three main stratigraphic units found within the pit, as well as the Osgood Mountain Stock. Altered blocks of granodiorite, rimmed by the skarn assemblage, are faulted downwards along the footwall structure into the Getchell Fault Zone and subsequently mineralised with gold (FirstMiss Gold Inc., 1993).\n"	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"07-SEP-2007 10:13:11"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"

The low-angle faults and associated folds are the result of Devonian and Permian-age compressional events and the higher angle faults and fracture sets formed during Tertiary extension. Mineralization is both structurally and stratigraphically controlled. \nThe Getchell fault is a zone of overlapping fractures which have an overall strike of N10W. Hotz and Willden (1964) offer evidence for up to 3500 feet of left lateral strike slip displacement and only a relatively small amount of dip slip movement along the Getchell fault. McCollum and McCollum (1991) indicate that the sense of movement on the Getchell fault is right lateral.  The Getchell Fault Zone is a complex system of sub-parallel, high angle faults which is at least 500 m wide. The zone is made up of a number of fault planes, separated by brecciated gouge and characterised by intense clay alteration, and by brecciation in the hangingwall.

The low-angle faults and associated folds are the result of Devonian and Permian-age compressional events and the higher angle faults and fracture sets formed during Tertiary extension. Mineralization is both structurally and stratigraphically controlled. \nThe Getchell fault is a zone of overlapping fractures which have an overall strike of N10W. Hotz and Willden (1964) offer evidence for up to 3500 feet of left lateral strike slip displacement and only a relatively small amount of dip slip movement along the Getchell fault. McCollum and McCollum (1991) indicate that the sense of movement on the Getchell fault is right lateral."	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"07-SEP-2007 10:13:05"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"

The proposed sequence of deformational events at Griffon is:\n(1) Early high-angle normal faulting striking roughly WNW that offsets Devonian through Mississippian rocks up to 55 meters (180 ft.).  (2) Upright, open folds trending N to NNE with possible thrust faulting. (3) Low-angle normal faulting which is most likely associated with the mineralizing event, since mineralized strata in the hanging-wall of this fault comprise both the Discovery Ridge and Hammer Ridge deposits.  (4) Several episodes of high-angle normal faulting and possible strike-slip faulting that commonly offset mineralized strata. (5) Later movement along the Blackrock fault, a major low-angle normal fault of probable Oligocene age in the southern part of the range. At Griffon, the Blackrock Fault moved after gold mineralization had occurred  and is interpreted to have been active between 31.3 and 14.3 Ma. \n"	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"07-SEP-2007 10:13:08"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"

BLOCK FAULTING CUTS THE ANTICLINE STRUCTURES OF SIERRA DE LA ENCANTADA. A REGIONAL N26W FAULT, TRACEABLE FOR 38 KM, CUTS THE ANTICLINORIUM SW OF THE MINE. THIS FAULT POSSIBLY REFLECTS REACTIVATION OF PALEOZOIC BASEMENT FAULTS DURING LARAMIDE TIME AND MAY HAVE CONTROLLED THE EMPLACEMENT OF THE GRANODIORITE BODY.

Tosdal and others (1996) believed that the precious-metal-bearing veins associated with the fault formed during two distinct stages, which resulted from a major change in the regional stress field. The first stage produced a local pressure shadow in the fault zone, which was invaded by hydrothermal fluids to form the high-grade sheeted vein complex. The second stage produced a larger but lower-grade set of veins spread over a 6,000-foot segment of the fault zone. The metalliferous veins are mostly within the tectonic melange in the immediate footwall side of the fault, although some mineralization is present in hydrothermally Knoxville Formation on the immediate hanging wall side of the fault. Width of the deposit appears to be restricted to the southwest by a large mass of serpentinite melange in the footwall and to the northeast by non-altered Knoxville Formation in the hanging wall. Vein thicknesses range from less than an inch to about two feet, but typically are no more than six inches. In general, stage 1 veins strike northeasterly, while stage 2 veins strike southeasterly."

The Carlin window is an erosionally breached, northwest-trending anticlinorium, exposing an autochthonous core beneath upperplate, siliceous and carbonate-clastic rocks of Devonian to Ordovician age in the Roberts Mountains overthrust sheet. Lower-plate exposures are bound by high-angle, normal faults on the southeastern, southwestern, and northwestern flanks of the Schroeder Mountain uplift. The margins of the window are down-faulted, and disconformably overlain by volcaniclastic sedimentary rock and gravel of the Tertiary Carlin Formation. Most of the deposits are in the southwestern part of the Carlin Window in a mile-wide  northwest-elongated belt of subdued topography along and in the footwall of the Good Hope reverse fault between Marys and Schroeder Mountains called the Tusc Corridor."

All faults may have been active during the hydrothermal system and acted as conduits for hydrothermal fluids. Many of the NNE-trending faults appear to have post-mineralization movement. In addition, ""ring faults"" down-drop the central ore zone.  Hydrothermal breccias are abundant in all levels of the deposit mined to date and are a major influence on ore grades. Three major types are recognized: 1) early white silica matrix breccias primarily developed in quartz-feldspar porphyry, 2) heterolithic black matrix breccia primarily developed in the ore-hosting tuff, and 3) heterolithic opal-jarosite matrix breccias. Types 1 and 3 are generally barren; black matrix breccias (type 2) formed during a major period of au mineralization and commonly constitute high grade gold-silver ore. Matrix of black matrix breccias is composed of fine-grained sugary quartz (<0.05 mm), anatase, and locally, fine-grained sulfide minerals (mostly pyrite or marcasite); vugs are common and are filled by coarser-grained quartz, barite, sulfides, and occasionally visible gold. The deposit is overlain by a black matrix hydrothermal breccia that was the discovery outcrop."	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"07-SEP-2007 10:13:00"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"

It is bounded on its north and south sides by E-W shear zones that provided magmatic pathways for stratovolcanoes, volcanic domes, breccia pipes, and other volcanic vents. The E-W zones also provided fluid pathways that resulted in adjacent hydrothermal gold deposits of the Pennsylvania, and other mining districts. The E-W shear zones are interpreted as transverse zones, which are broad belts of accommodation that enabled crust north and south of them to extend at different rates, amounts, and methods."

North- and northeast -striking moderate to high angle faults are numerous but typically display only minor displacement. Most of the historic gold and silver production has come from veins that occupy these structures, but not all structures are mineralized and many display movement that postdates gold-silver deposition. Displacement on these structures appears to be primarily normal, although oblique-normal displacement is indicated locally by shallowly dipping slickensides. NE-trending structures control the emplacement of late lithic tuff dikes along the SW flanks of Murray and Balloon Hills and the southern flanks of Hooligan Hill. Two major N-S to NNE-trending high angle structures clearly bound and may offset ore grade mineralization at Murray and Crazy hills. Structures with NW trends are rarely exposed but an overall NW trend can be inferred from the alignment of ore zones, the northwesterly strike of tilted structural blocks, the orientation of the Balloon Hill rhyolite and other rhyolite dikes."

The Rich Bar Fault forms the boundary between the Central belt and the Feather River perioditite belt, two of three major lithologic belts that occur in the northern Sierra Nevada. No known significant sources of lode-gold are associated with the fault in this vicinity, however.  About 3-4 miles upstream (east) from Rich Bar, the NW-trending Melones Fault Zone crosses the East Branch. Here at Rich Gulch, the fault zone is associated with an important zone of low-sulfide gold-quartz veins that may be the source for some of the gold downstream at Rich Bar."

The Tonopah Divide shaft developed the Divide lode which occupies the large Divide fault (Boden, 1992). On the west side of Gold Mountain the Mormon Girl fault appears to be a parallel right lateral fault of this set. Between these major faults are transcurrent north-northeast trending faults which accommodated minor right-lateral strike-slip motion. These fault sets clearly postdate earlier gold mineralized faults of the E-W trending and north dipping Gold Zone. The Gold Zone is parallel to and an easterly extension of the N 80?E listric Kernick fault on Hasbrouck Mountain. Gold-silver mineralization is known to occur almost exclusively in the hangingwall of the Gold Zone-Kernick fault system in the Divide district. Many of the mineralized faults found in the hangingwall of the Gold Zone are WNW trending high angle faults which may have fed the basal Siebert tuff unit. Interestingly Erdman (1992) noted a 'NW striking (more westerly?) gold bearing silicified fault was mapped that offset the Divide lode at the south end of the Falcon Pit'. This further suggests that at least some Gold Mountain mineralization occurred after the Divide fault ceased its right lateral motion."

To the north-east it heads towards the Chimney Creek orebody. The NNW trending faulting of the Getchell Fault Zone post dates east-west crossing structures, but pre-dates, or is contemporaneous with, north-east and north-west trending structures and joint swarms. These north-east and north-west cross-structures tend not to be displaced, but commonly coalesce with the Getchell Fault Zone, favouring the interpretation that they are largely contemporaneous. They also appear to exert a major control on ore deposition. The older east-west fault and joint sets produce graben structures throughout the mine area, some of which drop the Valmy Formation down to become juxtaposed with the Comus Formation.\nGold mineralization is generally found at the intersection of a number of high-angle and low-angle fault sets. The low-angle faults and associated folds are the result of Devonian and Permian-age compressional events and the higher angle faults and fracture sets formed during Tertiary extension. Mineralization is both structurally and stratigraphically controlled. \n"	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"07-SEP-2007 10:12:59"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"
