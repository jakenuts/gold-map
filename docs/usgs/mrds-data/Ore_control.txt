This conformable sedimentary contact was the focus for lateral movement of hydrothermal fluids. The upper 100 feet of the pilot shale is a less permeable claystone and may have capped hydrothermal fluids.  Structural controls: the Vantage fault served as a conduit for rising hydrothermal fluids. There is also evidence of a north-northeast striking asymmetrical anticline running the length of the deposits. The axis of the anticline would lie along the strike of the three vantage deposits and plunges gently to the southwest. Along the crest of the anticline numerous extensional fractures and extensive brecciation may have provided conduits for the ore-bearing solutions."

There are at least seven major phases of intrusions that collectively form what are called the East and West stocks. All seven phases contain molybdenum mineralization.  The main buckingham deposit formed in association with five igneous phases located in the two stocks.  All five phases developed shells of molybdenite mineralization and the shells locally overlap to produce grades of  about 0.1 to 0.20 weight percent MoS2.  Mineralization is also locally controlled by  shear zones, faults, and  fractures ."	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"

Most of the known orebodies occur in the upper 250 m of the Roberts Mountains Formation, principally within a unit consisting of interbedded dark gray, medium bedded, bioclastic limestone and thinly laminated, silty dolomitic limestone.  A small amount of ore at the east end of the east orebody occurs in calcareous shale of the upper plate.  High grades of gold probably are linked to increased permeability due to decarbonatization.The Roberts Mountains Thrust does not appear to localize ore either at the Carlin deposit or elsewhere in the district."

4303	"10310702"	1	""	"Economic gold mineralization occurs within two felsite (rhyolite) breccia pipes.  Gold occurs as fine, rounded inclusions inside of coarse, euhedral pyrite or in contact with pyrite as fracture fillings or along grain boundaries (Corbett, 1980, cited in Sharp, 1984, pg. 138).  The more numerous occurrences are as fillings and boundary coatings.  The gold was further determined to be alloyed with silver and of a size range of 1 to 30 microns with the majority from 5 to 20 microns.\n\nAs reported by Davis and others (1989), gold at the Colosseum Mine is generally submicroscopic and associated with sulfide mineralization, chiefly pyrite.  It occurs as free gold, with minor alloyed silver.  It is primarily in contact with pyrite in fractures in the pyrite or along pyrite grain edges.  Secondarily, it occurs as isolated particles in quartz and other gangue minerals but spatially always close to pyrite, and rarely as particles encased in euhedral pyrite.\n\nThe pyrite mineralization and minor base metal sulfides occur in three distinct styles: (1) as disseminations, (2) as open space filling or vein/fracture filling, and (3) in breccia clasts replacing dolomite.  The pyrite megascopically ranges from absent to 30% of rock volume within the breccia pipes (Davis and others, 1989).\n\nAlthough the gold is apparently spatially and geochemically associated with pyrite, there is only a general proportional relationship between pyrite content and gold content.  Sometimes, a high volume percentage of pyrite has only geochemically anomalous gold.  This makes visual pyrite only a general  grade control tool and not a specific tool  This further makes the ore control  process all the more difficult.\n"	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"20-FEB-2008 00:00:00"	"Schruben, Paul"	"20-FEB-2008 00:00:00"

The upper levels of the original underground Copper Canyon Mine, the West orebody, and the East orebody are of the central copper-gold skarn type.  Copper-silver skarn deposits include the Fortitude and Tomboy-Minnie deposits, and the Sunshine, Bonanza, and South Canyon deposits of the Reona project.  Distal lead-zinc-silver deposits include the mines & prospects of the  Galena Canyon area and a lower-level deposit of the old  Copper Canyon Mine.\nMineralization in the Copper Canyon underground mine was characterized by veins in sub-parallel N-trending fractures, with chalcocite-enriched zones.There is a series of subparallel N-trending fractures and faults some of which controlled ore formation."

The Gold Quarry Main ore zone occurs at the intersection of two such faults: the Gold Quarry fault which strikes N40E, dips 75 SE and the Good Hope fault system which strikes N40W, dips steeply SW. The 90 degree intersection of these two faults was marked by a prominent outcrop of jasperoid breccia. The outcrop was sheared, brecciated, and contained open-space, silica-coated fractures. Many smaller faults which parallel the Good Hope and Gold Quarry trends occur within the deposit, creating a pervasive fracture system. This fracture system controls gold deposition at all scales from preferential localization along faults up to 15 ft. Wide to microfractures 50 microns apart. The Deep West orebody is controlled by the sedimentary/structural contact between footwall carbonate rocks and hanging wall siliciclastic rocks. The primary feeder conduit for mineralizing fluids is a steeply-dipping breccia pipe formed at the intersection of the Grey/Challenger structural system and the NW-striking Hangfire fault. Fissures, fractures zones, faulting,  folding all controlled ore deposition. The Less fault, a high-angle NE-striking structure was  an ore-controlling structure  in the original Maggie Creek pit."

The predominant permeable host rock lithologies are a basal lithic sandstone (well-sorted litharenite) and  an overlying polylithic breccia (mostly conglomeratic with abundant hydrothermal and tectonic brecciation). Overlying these two lithologies is a thick unit of lacustrine mudstones which appears to have acted as an impermeable cap for localizing silica and gold mineralization in the more permeable units below it. The structural axis and hydrothermal conduit for the Main Zone mineralization does not appear to have a surface expression; but drilling has outlined a major north-south zone about which the gold mineralization has spread laterally. Because the major gold resource has no surface expression, and Quaternary alluvium and basalts blanket much of the area, the presence and amount of any fault displacement of the ore zones is speculative.\nMineralization"	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"

Sporadic gold values occur along northeast trending structures.  The major mineralization is within 3000 feet of the Goldstrike Stock, although it is believed to be considerably younger than the stock.  Mineralization is also stratigraphically controlled along permeable sedimentary and hydrothermal breccias, bioclastic lenses, and calcareous siltstone horizons that intersect the faults.  At Post, oxide ore generally occurs in the Rodeo Creek unit, while refractory sulfide ore typically occurs in the Popovich Formation.  High grade mineralization (>1.0 opt Au) at Deep Post occurs along the sheared contact between sedimentary and intrusive rocks, and commonly below skarns and hornfels adjacent to the earlier intrusions; auriferous fluids apparently ponded beneath these impermeable lithologies."

Lapilli tuffs and volcaniclastic rocks acted as permeable aquifers allowing lateral flow of hydrothermal fluids.  Electrum and acanthite deposition occurred 30-150 meters below the paleosurface as replacement and void space fillings.  Boiling of hydrothermal fluid and microscale hydrothermal brecciation are probably associated with Au-Ag deposition.  Intense near surface silicification led to self-sealing of the hydrothermal system, resulting in the explosive production of larger scale breccias, which localized later acanthite+electrum+pyrargyrite deposition (e.g. at the historic Tonopah Hasbrouck Mine)."

Gold mineralization at Lone Tree occurs in all three units (Valmy Formation, Antler Sequence, Havallah Sequence) and is largely confined to a N-S trending zone of intense fracturing and faulting known as the Wayne Zone. The Wayne Zone dips steeply to the west and has been traced for nearly a mile along strike on the Lone Tree property. Major cross structures offset and pinch the Wayne Zone at the northern and southern ends of Lone Tree Hill."

The vein system is a complex characterized by ribbon-structured milky quartz with septa of slate as well as carbonate-type altered greenstone and serpentinite. According to Hehnke (1990), all significant gold mineralization in the Mary Harrison group is hosted by hydrothermally altered greenstone; high-grade mineralization is associated with brecciation and stockwork quartz-carbonate veining.  Locally, high-grade mineralization is found in QAM rock adjacent to massive quartz veins and in association with swarms of porphyritic dikes."

District-wide, Albers and Bain (1985) identified three main linear trends, N23?E, N37?E, and N60?E defined by faults, clusters of ore bodies and the long axes of ore bodies.  Furthermore they noted that most of the large ore bodies occur at the intersections of these trends and surmised that the faults, especially at the intersections, provided conduits for emanating ore fluids. Post-mineral normal faults disrupt the lateral continuity of the ore.   \n\nThe massive sulfide occurs with sharp contact within the upper unit of the Balaklala Rhyolite.

Where the volcanics and granodiorite are in depositional contact, the volcanics are more intensely altered and mineralized.  At the Serita Mine, the ore occurs in steeply dipping or vertical zones that extend upward from the basement contact.  The mineralized ""ledges"" are fault-controlled and occur along faults and in association with subsidiary faults oriented 90? or 45? to the strike of the ledges.  At the Chemung Mine, highest ore grades occur at intersections of cross faults and the main veins (""ledges"").  At the Perini and ""Goldfound"" (Gold Fund) mines, stoping is most prevalent on cross faults in the ""ledges"".\n\nThe hard silicified ""ledges"" formed in association with faulting.  Subsequent faulting shattered the ledges, providing permeable passageways for subsequent gold-bearing hydrothermal fluids.  Gouge zones are present along the margins of the ledges.  At the Serita Mine, silicification is areal in extent as compared to silicified linear ""ledges"" in other parts of the district.  All of the productive mines in the district have been in silicified zones or ledges, but not all such zones or ledges have been productive.\n\nThe northeast trending fault zone north of Masonic Mountain is a likely candidate for the deeper portion of the hydrothermal system associated with gold mineralization in the Masonic District. \n"	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"20-FEB-2008 00:00:00"	"Schruben, Paul"	"20-FEB-2008 00:00:00"

The Blue Eagle-Cactus Queen vein formed along a fault between the granitic basement rock and the volcanic dome complex. The Au-Ag-bearing fluids migrated through dilatant fault zones during episodic movements associated with regional tectonism. Repeated rupture-rehealing events, without boiling, are interpreted as having created secondary zones of permeability. These zones were the sites of stockworks composed of quartz-adularia-sericite.

A change in dip of the main quartz vein, over a distance of 20 feet, at the 590-foot level (7th level) may have influenced ore deposition below that level. The ore grade was described as low from this level to the 749-level ($5 per ton) in contrast to higher grade ore from the first six levels."

Most of the gold is found along the footwall, where open-space-filling occurred during gold deposition; gold was concentrated in areas where solutions pooled. The presence of some microbreccia and pebble-breccia fragments suggest that the fault was reactivated post-mineralization. Mineralization appears to follow  bedding plane faults and fractures that crosscut bedding."	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"

The NNW-striking set of normal faults defines the most noticeable trend of mineralization on the district level; higher grade pods usually flow this direction.  The N60E set of normal faults is second in importance and serves to control mineralization at the individual pits.

Stratigraphically, the ore is contained within the basal 100 feet of the Pilot Shale, which here consists of siltstone and limestone. The lower Pilot limestone contains the highest grade material. The upper siltstones of the Pilot Shale contain very little mineralization and may have acted as an impermeable cap to the mineralizing fluids."
