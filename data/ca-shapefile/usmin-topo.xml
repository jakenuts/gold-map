      <abstract>Version 10.0 of these data are part of a larger U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) project to develop an updated geospatial database of mines, mineral deposits, and mineral regions in the United States. Mine and prospect-related symbols, such as those used to represent prospect pits, mines, adits, dumps, tailings, etc., hereafter referred to as “mine” symbols or features, have been digitized from the 7.5-minute (1:24,000, 1:25,000-scale; and 1:10,000, 1:20,000 and 1:30,000-scale in Puerto Rico only) and the 15-minute (1:48,000 and 1:62,500-scale; 1:63,360-scale in Alaska only) archive of the USGS Historical Topographic Map Collection (HTMC), or acquired from available databases (California and Nevada, 1:24,000-scale only). Compilation of these features is the first phase in capturing accurate locations and general information about features related to mineral resource exploration and extraction across the U.S. The compilation of 725,690 point and polygon mine symbols from approximately 106,350 maps across 50 states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (PR) and the District of Columbia (DC) has been completed: Alabama (AL), Alaska (AK), Arizona (AZ), Arkansas (AR), California (CA), Colorado (CO), Connecticut (CT), Delaware (DE), Florida (FL), Georgia (GA), Hawaii (HI), Idaho (ID), Illinois (IL), Indiana (IN), Iowa (IA), Kansas (KS), Kentucky (KY), Louisiana (LA), Maine (ME), Maryland (MD), Massachusetts (MA), Michigan (MI), Minnesota (MN), Mississippi (MS), Missouri (MO), Montana (MT), Nebraska (NE), Nevada (NV), New Hampshire (NH), New Jersey (NJ), New Mexico (NM), New York (NY), North Carolina (NC), North Dakota (ND), Ohio (OH), Oklahoma (OK), Oregon (OR), Pennsylvania (PA), Rhode Island (RI), South Carolina (SC), South Dakota (SD), Tennessee (TN), Texas (TX), Utah (UT), Vermont (VT), Virginia (VA), Washington (WA), West Virginia (WV), Wisconsin (WI), and Wyoming (WY). The process renders not only a more complete picture of exploration and mining in the U.S., but an approximate timeline of when these activities occurred. These data may be used for land use planning, assessing abandoned mine lands and mine-related environmental impacts, assessing the value of mineral resources from Federal, State and private lands, and mapping mineralized areas and systems for input into the land management process. These data are presented as three groups of layers based on the scale of the source maps. No reconciliation between the data groups was done.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data are a digital version of mine symbols found on USGS 7.5- and 15-minute series topographic maps. These data are suitable for use in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) or other database and geospatial software. Collection of data of this type is a part of the mission of the Mineral Resources Program of the USGS. The information is intended to meet the needs of a wide community of users that extends from geoscience and mineral exploration communities to State and Federal agencies, private industry, and the general public.</purpose>
      <supplinf>This USGS data release consists of an ArcGIS 10.8.1 geodatabase (USGS_TopoMineSymbols_ver10.gdb) containing six feature classes representing the different scales of topographic maps:

USGS_TopoMineSymbols_24k_Points;
USGS_TopoMineSymbols_48k_Points;
USGS_TopoMineSymbols_625k_Points;
USGS_TopoMineSymbols_24k_Polygons;
USGS_TopoMineSymbols_48k_Polygons;
USGS_TopoMineSymbols_625k_Polygons

No reconciliation between the data sets was done. Raster images of historic topographic maps may be obtained from the USGS topoView web mapping application: https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/topoview/.</supplinf>

    <datacred>Datasets were developed by the U.S. Geological Survey Geology, Geophysics, and Geochemistry Science Center (GGGSC). Compilation work was completed by USGS National Association of Geoscience Teachers (NAGT) interns: Emma L. Boardman-Larson, Grayce M. Gibbs, William R. Gnesda, Montana E. Hauke, Jacob D. Melendez, Amanda L. Ringer, and Alex J. Schwarz; USGS student contractors: Margaret B. Hammond, Germán Schmeda, Patrick C. Scott, Tyler Reyes, Morgan Mullins, Thomas Carroll, Margaret Brantley, and Logan Barrett; and by USGS personnel Virgil S. Alfred, Damon Bickerstaff, E.G. Boyce, Madelyn E. Eysel, Stuart A. Giles, Autumn L. Helfrich, Alan A. Hurlbert, Cheryl L. Novakovich, Sophia J. Pinter, and Andrew F. Smith.</datacred>

    </attracc>
    <logic>Digital data were checked throughout the compilation process for accuracy of mine feature locations, completeness, accuracy, and consistency of attributes; completeness of data capture; and appropriate representation of mine features through time. A final review (see "Process Step" section – fourth level review) consisted of randomly selecting 5 quadrangles per state (some with multiple versions per quadrangle) and comparing the maps to the digitized data. Errors, which included missing, mislocated or misattributed data, were tabulated and an error percentage was calculated. From these results it is estimated that the error rate is less than 1-percent.</logic>
    <complete>Available 7.5- and 15-minute topographic maps were acquired on a state-by-state basis from the HTMC for the archived period of record (1886 to 2006). More recent topographic maps in the USGS USTopo series do not include mine symbols and thus were not relevant. For quadrangles where HTMC topographic maps were not available, a lower-resolution USGS digital raster graphic version of the map was used. In specific regions such as South Dakota, 1:25,000-scale topographic maps were used to fill gaps. Mine feature data compiled by the states of California and Nevada were also based on USGS 7.5-minute topographic maps. Because the HTMC archive was not available at the time of those compilations, the California and Nevada mine features were probably acquired from a single, most recent version of each topographic map. The California and Nevada datasets were subsequently updated by USGS staff to include polygonal and point mine features from older versions of topographic maps where available. Automated routines and reviews were used to check the completeness of map coverage for each state.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps adhere to National Map Accuracy Standards that specify that for maps on publication scales larger than 1:20,000, not more than 10 percent of the points tested shall be in error by more than 1/30th inch, measured on the publication scale; for maps on publication scales of 1:20,000 or smaller, 1/50th inch. As applied to the USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle topographic map, the horizontal accuracy standard requires that the positions of 90 percent of all points tested must be accurate within 1/50th of an inch on the map. At 1:24,000 scale, 1/50th of an inch is 40 feet, at 1:48,000 scale, 1/50th of an inch is 80 feet, at 1:62,500 scale, 1/50th of an inch is 104 feet.
This data set was captured by heads-up digitizing from georeferenced raster images of USGS topographic maps from the HTMC. Georeferencing error was checked by measuring the distance between the corners of topographic maps and the actual coordinates of the corner. This error was found to be 50 feet on the average.
The combination of map accuracy and georeferencing error gives an average horizontal accuracy for features in the data set that ranges from about 100 to 155 feet.</horizpar>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>A data search by state was conducted to ascertain where digital, geospatial mine feature information from 7.5 and 15-minute topographic maps were available. Geospatial mine feature data, available for Nevada and California at 1;24,000-scale, were acquired and used as a starting point for those states. For remaining states, historical 7.5- and 15-minute topographic maps were acquired from the USGS Historical Topographic Map Collection/topoView website (https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/topoview/) as geoPDF files. In the 7.5-minute series, about 60 percent of the quadrangles had multiple versions. In the 15-minute, 1:48,000-scale series, about 10 percent of the maps had multiple versions, and in the 15-minute, 1:62,500-scale series, about 20 percent of the maps had multiple versions. For quadrangles with two map versions at the same scale, both maps were acquired. For quadrangles with more than two versions at the same scale, the oldest map, and versions at approximately 10-year intervals up to the most recent were acquired. Using Global Mapper software, acquired maps were converted from geoPDF to geoTIF format to make them accessible in ArcGIS.

Capture of mine features was accomplished at each scale by visually inspecting the maps for mine symbols and digitizing points and/or polygons into an ArcGIS file geodatabase. No reconciliation between these data from different map scales was done. For example, if a mine feature occurred on a 7.5-minute map and a similar feature occurred on a 15-minute map, the feature was digitized twice. Information describing the feature type (prospect pits, mines, adits, dumps, tailings, etc.) and the map date, name, and Geospatial Data Architecture (GDA) and Scan identification number was compiled in the corresponding attribute table. Where mine symbols occurred on multiple versions (dates) of a map of the same scale, the first occurrence of the symbol was digitized. If subsequent versions of the map showed the same symbol within a permissible tolerance of the original location, the symbol was not re-digitized. The permissible tolerance for point symbols was roughly the area of a "box" which completely enclosed the map symbol. In the case of polygonal features, if the shape of the feature changed between map versions, the entire polygon was re-digitized. Slight shifts between versions of a map were common and reflected map scanning and georegistration variance.

When mine symbols were located within a topographic depression but no explicit pit outline was shown on the map, the depression was assumed to be a pit related to mining activity and the outermost depression contour was digitized as a polygon. The polygon was then attributed according to the mine symbol and/or the label contained on the map. When a map label name was surrounded by numerous symbols, the closest major symbol received the name. For example, if a name was surrounded by prospect pit and adit symbols on the map, the name would be applied to the closest adit symbol.

Pre-existing, 1:24,000-scale mine feature data for the states of Nevada and California were checked for locational accuracy; attribute table schema were modified and updated for consistency; and mine features (point and polygon) from older versions of maps were captured.

Data inspection and checks were performed by the individual digitizing the maps (first-level review), by team members reviewing a random selection of maps in a state (second-level review), by a project lead who reviewed data compiled at the state level (third-level review), and a final spot check of the merged data for the western US by USGS colleagues (fourth-level review). In each case, reviews addressed the accuracy and completeness of mine feature capture, completeness and consistency of attributes, adherence to established project schema, and representation of mine features through time.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Similar to the initial process step, mine symbols on 7.5- and 15-minute topographic maps for the states of Arkansas (AR), Iowa (IA), Louisiana (LA), Minnesota (MN), Missouri (MO), and Texas (TX) were digitized and appended to the existing source data. Some notable changes were made to some of the database attribute values.

Terms in the attribute field Ftr_Type were modified as follows: 1) added "Iron Pit" and "Shell Pit"; 2) changed "Ore Storage Pond" to "Ore Stockpile/Storage"; moved "Ore Storage Pond" to Ftr_Name; 3) changed "Tailings - Thickener" to "Tailings - Undifferentiated"; moved "Tailing Thickeners" to Ftr_Name; 4) changed "Pumice Mine" to "Pumice Pit"; moved "Pumice Mine" to Ftr_Name; 5) changed "Unidentified Feature" to "Disturbed Surface" or "Disturbed Surface - Pit"; and 6) changed "Gravel/Borrow pit - Undifferentiated" to "Gravel/Borrow Pit - Undifferentiated".

Terms removed from the Remarks field include:  1) "Unidentified - generic disturbed ground symbol"; 2) "Unidentified - generic disturbed ground symbol. Labeled as Pit only"; 3) "Photorevised"; 4) "Revised"; and 5) "Coincident feature labeled as &lt;Ftr_Type&gt; on 19xx map" (changed to "Feature designated as &lt;Ftr_Type&gt; from feature on 19xx map").

Unlabeled features attributed as Ftr_Type "Disturbed Surface" or "Disturbed Surface - Pit" (previously attributed as "Unidentified Feature"), were re-evaluated to identify some of these features. A buffer was applied to identify other nearby labeled features within approximately 1 kilometer. If it was reasonable to assume that a nearby labeled feature could be used to infer the Ftr_Type of the unlabeled "Disturbed Surface" feature, then the Ftr_Type was changed and the Remark "Inferred &lt;Ftr_Type&gt; from adjacent feature" was entered in the Remarks field. For example, several polygons labeled as "gravel pits" are present on a map dated 1950. A 1980 version of the map contains some pink, photorevised unlabeled disturbed surface polygons near the 1950 polygons. The 1980 disturbed surface polygons were assigned the Ftr_Type "Gravel Pit" and "Inferred Gravel Pit from adjacent feature." was entered in the Remarks field. This was not done when multiple Ftr_Types surrounded an unlabeled feature or if it was not reasonable to infer the Ftr_Type based on geographic factors.

The field "Topo_Date" has been changed from a text field type to an integer field type to facilitate numeric analysis.

        <procdesc>Version 9.0 - Similar to the initial process step, mine symbols on 7.5- and 15-minute topographic maps for the state of West Virginia (WV) were digitized and appended to the existing source data. Some portions of the West Virginia 1:24,000-scale polygons were supplemented with work done by Aaron Maxwell (Assistant Professor in the Department of Geology and Geography at West Virginia University) and his lab group at the West Virginia View consortium (Maxwell, 2020). They used a previously published version of this dataset for the state of Kentucky to train deep learning models. These were then applied to ~1300 historic 1:24,000-scale topographic map quadrangles in West Virginia to extract the land disturbance extents. These rasters were vectorized into shapefiles and shared with the USGS team. The rasterized vector polygons were smoothed using Esri geoprocessing tools and a 40-meter PAEK generalization. They were simplified further by removing extra vertices within a 1-meter tolerance. The data was then reprojected from the native topographic map datum of NAD 1927 to WGS 1984. The polygons were cleaned up further by removal of raster artifacts by comparing each feature to the symbology on the georeferenced topographic maps. Attribution of the USGS data tables and the capture of point features for these maps used the same process as previous versions of this dataset.

            <edomvd>A horizontal or inclined tunnel driven from the surface for exploration, extracting ore or for dewatering a mine; also referred to as a tunnel or prospect tunnel. The symbol is named a "mine tunnel or cave entrance" in the USGS topographic map legend. Direction approximated by the value in Ftr_Azimuth field. The adit direction shown on USGS topographic maps is generally perpendicular to the slope rather than the actual direction of the adit. Any associated descriptive label such as the proper mine name, "Tunnel", "Mine", "Coal Mine" or "Cave" were entered in the Ftr_Name field.</edomvd>

            <edomv>Gravel/Borrow Pit - Undifferentiated</edomv>
            <edomvd>A pit or excavation from which sand, gravel, clay or aggregate are extracted, usually for construction purposes. A feature was given this designation where there was no label associated with a borrow pit symbol or it was only labeled "Pit". The designation was also used if no Ftr_Type domain existed for a descriptive label associated with a borrow pit symbol. In these cases, the descriptive label was entered in the Ftr_Name field. Some examples: Asphalt Pit, Peat Pit, Coal Pit, or Rock Pit.</edomvd>

          <udom>The name of the feature as labeled on the topographic map. This could be a proper name like "Carlin Mine" or "Johnson Shaft" or may contain other descriptive parts of the label depending on the Ftr_Type. For example, "Tunnel", "Pit", "Mine", "Cave", or "Reclaimed". Descriptors were recorded where the map label clarified a symbol (e.g. a "Mine" label was adjacent to an adit symbol). This field was also used for any descriptive labels of features that do not have their own feature type. For example: a gravel/borrow pit symbol with a label of "Slate Pit". The Ftr_Type is "Gravel/Borrow Pit - Undifferentiated" and the Ftr_Name is "Slate Pit".
When a map label name was surrounded by numerous symbols, the closest major symbol received the name. For example, if a feature label name was surrounded by prospect pit and adit symbols on the map, the name would be applied to the closest adit symbol. In the rare case where more than three proper mine names were within the same polygon, the Ftr_Name was attributed "Jack's Mine; and others - see Remarks" and the Remarks field contains the other names.</udom>

Where topographic quadrangles have multiple versions, the date reflects the first appearance of a mine symbol on a map. For instance, an adit symbol is shown on a topographic map printed in 1960, 1970, and 1980. The value of "Topo_Date" is 1960.

          <udom>The majority of these data were captured by USGS contractor personnel via heads-up digitizing of mine symbols and labels on scanned topographic maps. Point data from 1:24,000-scale maps for the states of California and Nevada were obtained from the California Department of Conservation ("CA Dept Conserv") and the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology (NBMG). The obtained data were reviewed and modified to include point and polygon features from older versions of maps, and to conform to the USGS attribute schema.</udom>

            <edomv>Feature crosses into and digitized on &lt;Topo_Date&gt; &lt;Topo_Name&gt; map.</edomv>
            <edomvd>Used when a polygon feature crossed a quadrangle boundary and was digitized from more than one map. For example, the extent of a gravel pit polygon crosses a 1:24,000 quadrangle boundary and is digitized from a 1982 Globe and a 1982 Inspiration map. The quadrangle containing the largest extent of the polygon (1982 Globe map) was entered into the Topo_Date and Topo_Name field and "Feature crosses into and digitized on 1982 Inspiration map" was entered in the Remarks field.</edomvd>

            <edomv>Feature designated as &lt;Ftr_Type&gt; from feature on 19xx map.</edomv>
            <edomvd>Denotes where point/polygon features on one map were used to attribute a point/polygon on a different year version of the map. For example, a 1950 map had numerous point symbols labeled as "gravel pits". A 1980 map had an unlabeled polygon that overlaps these point symbols. The unlabeled polygon was assigned the Ftr_Type of "Gravel Pit" and "Feature designated as Gravel Pit from feature on 1950 map" was entered in the Remarks field.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>Used when the label (not the symbol) of a feature changes on a different year version of the map. For example, a borrow pit symbol on a 1950 map was unlabeled. On the 1980 version of the map, the same symbol was labeled "gravel pit". The Ftr_Type was changed to "Gravel Pit", and "Labeled as Gravel Pit on 1980 map" was entered in the Remarks field.</edomvd>

A 1980 map had the same mine shaft with the label "John Doe Mine". The 1950 feature was attributed "John Doe Mine" in the Ftr_Name field and "Named on 1980 map" was entered in the Remarks field.</edomvd>
