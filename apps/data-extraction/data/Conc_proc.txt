A 5-10 foot thick gossan-like cap of intense hematitic alteration, solution cavities, total decalcification and moderate to strong argillization immediately overlies the orebody. Secondary zinc grading 1.0-4.0 wt.% is concentrated in the top 200 feet (60 m) of the sulfide zone. Strongest concentrations are at central West Mike, in the footwall of the Corridor fault, along the Good Hope fault, and along the Soap Creek fault zone. Top-of-sulfide zinc is hosted in micron-size, brown-yellow sphalerite occurring with manganosiderite and arsenopyrite in clay-altered sections. Secondary silver is concentrated in 90-foot (27-m) thick layers, which locally straddle the base of oxidation along the Soap Creek fault zone and grade up to 1.2 opt (41 g/t). Supergene silver occurs with lead at an average 1:60 ratio, but not with gold. "	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"	"Schruben, Paul"	"01-SEP-2007 00:00:00"
