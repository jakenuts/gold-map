Uplift of the range began a few million years ago and is still going on as a product of convergence between the North American and Pacific Plates along the bend in the San Andreas Fault.  It was accomplished by reverse faulting along the southern range margin and broad arching across the interior and northern margin, with uplift extending northeastward across the San Andreas Fault.  The relatively simple pattern and style of uplift are superimposed upon the complex structure of rocks exposed within the range (Ehlig, 1981, pg.254)"	"Surveys and Analysis Project"	"20-FEB-2008 00:00:00"	"Schruben, Paul"	"20-FEB-2008 00:00:00"

Other major regional structures include faults and related features associated with the San Andreas Fault system.  Complicating the geologic setting within the region are detachment fault features identified at the Picacho Mine and American Girl Mine, and intricate strike-slip fault systems identified at the Mesquite Mine."

Important wrench fault systems were formed sometime during this period. The gold deposits found along the Carlin Trend are believed to be related to a northwest trending wrench fault that was active as early as the Jurassic era, moving at the time in a left-lateral sense. These high-angle faults are critical to localizing the fluid flow responsible for the deposition of gold deposits in central and eastern Nevada."

An autochthonous block of rocks remains at the center of these tectonic events, and it contains the Penn-Perm Battle Formation, Antler Peak Limestone, and Edna Formation,  which rocks often form the host rocks for mineralization in many of the Battle Mountain skarn deposits."
