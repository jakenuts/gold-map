## Technical Considerations

### Data Structure
The current implementation uses a simulated data structure that matches common mining claim data:

```typescript
interface MiningClaim {
  id: string;
  claimId: string;
  claimName: string;
  claimType: 'lode' | 'placer' | 'mill' | 'tunnel';
  status: 'active' | 'closed' | 'void';
  township: string;
  range: string;
  section: string;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  filingDate: string;
  lastUpdated: string;
}
```

### State Management
The application uses React Context for state management, handling:
- Layer visibility
- Filter settings
- Map viewport state
- UI state (loading, errors)

### Performance
Current performance optimizations include:
- Viewport-based data loading
- React Query caching
- Efficient re-renders
- Proper cleanup of map instances

## Deployment Considerations

1. Environment Setup
- Configure environment variables for API endpoints
- Set up proper CORS headers
- Configure cache policies

2. Security
- Implement API key management
- Add rate limiting
- Set up proper CSP headers

3. Monitoring
- Add error tracking
- Implement performance monitoring
- Set up usage analytics

## Maintenance Plan

1. Regular Updates
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Update map styles and assets

2. Performance Monitoring
- Track load times
- Monitor memory usage
- Analyze user interactions

3. User Feedback
- Implement feedback collection
- Monitor error reports
- Track feature requests

## Conclusion
The initial implementation provides a solid foundation for displaying and interacting with mining claims data. The modular architecture allows for easy integration of real data sources and addition of new features. The next steps focus on enhancing functionality, improving performance, and ensuring maintainability.
